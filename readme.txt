Controls:
Because this game is played on the iPhone, the only control will be the touch button that shoots the bullets.

How to play:
Missile command is a game where the player has to protect his 6 cities from incoming missiles. He has a base filled with 30 counter-missile bullets. These bullets, when shot in front of the incoming missiles, will destroy them in their tracks. If you run out of your 30 bullets, you automatically lose. You'll also lose if all 6 of your cities are destroyed. Beware, when you've destroyed an incoming missile, two more will come. However, when 9 missiles have been launched, then only 1 missile comes at a time. For every missile you destroy, you gain 25 points. You'll proceed to the next level once you've destroyed 13 missiles (There's only one level in this game). For every city you have left, you gain an additional 55 points, and for every bullet you have left, you gain an additional 20 points. 

There are no bugs in this game.
